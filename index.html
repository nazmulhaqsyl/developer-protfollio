                <h2>Mission</h1>
                    <p>
                        In this year 2022 i selected the mission of being web developer. For that reason i am trying my
                        heart and soul to achieve the goal of a developer. First i have learned the challenging part of
                        this
                        platform which is the programming language. Then after getting a huge knowledge about core
                        language
                        of web developing now i am trying to solve some programming related problems.

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    My vision is to develop myself as a senior web developer. For that reason i am trying my
                    heart and soul to achieve the goal of a developer. First of all, i have to set my goal for being a
                    web developer. After achiving the goal of being web developer my first duty to solve the worst cases
                    of functionality that a problem raises.

                </p>

                <h2>Target</h2>
                <p>
                    Now i am disscussing about our target about this platform. A web developer has too many targeted
                    customers for performing well. First of all, we need to announce or publish our skills on social
                    media and newspapers. After achiving the goal we need to provide best services of development in
                    this sector.
